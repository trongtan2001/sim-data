### 😍 WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY ABOUT WP DARK MODE!

> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
[` 💙 Best dark mode plugin currently available!`](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/best-dark-mode-plugin-currently-available/)

> *I’ve always been a busy fan of dark mode and have tried diff plugins over the years including WP Dark Mode, Darklups, Dracula Dark Mode, DarkMySite, Darklooks, Darkify, Dusky Dark Mode, and bla blah. I started using WP Dark Mode back in 2021 and really loved how it worked on my site. I even tried custom code snippets – it was really fun!
But in mid 2023, I switched to Dracula because of its color compatibility. However, after WP Dark Mode’s recent updates and revamp, I decided to give it another try – and I’ve fallen in love with it all over again! The latest version really takes things up a notch and works perfectly with my site. Good work WP Dark Mode team.*
